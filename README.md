# Mine-Localization-Robot-using-Firebird-V

Real Time Motion planning and grid solving for a 7 x 7 grid with mines represented by basic obstacles occupying a single coordinate
Robot reaches the specified end position with information display: the total number of mines and location of each mine on the grid.

Algorithms used: Breadth First Search, Djikstraâ€™s Algorithm for return

Development on Fire Bird V ATMEGA2560 Robotic Research Platform, Nex Robotics, IIT Bombay
